# Epic Wallet - Build, Configuration and Running

## Requirements

**The requirements for building the wallet are the same from the epic server. You can check them in the topic [Requirements](https://github.com/EpicCash/epic/blob/master/doc/build.md#requirements) in the Epic server build instructions.**

## Build steps

```sh
git clone https://github.com/EpicCash/epic-wallet
cd epic-wallet
git submodule update --init --recursive
cargo update
cargo build --release
```

The epic wallet can also be built in debug mode (without the `--release` flag, but using the `--debug` or the `--verbose` flag).

## What was built

A successful build gets you:

* `target/release/epic-wallet` - the main epic wallet binary

## Running the Epic Wallet

**To run the epic-wallet, you also need an epic server running.**

- Instruction of how to run the epic server using the .deb package can be found in the topic [Running the Epic Server](https://github.com/EpicCash/epic/blob/master/doc/running.org#wallet_server).
- If you want to build it from source code, instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/EpicCash/epic/blob/master/doc/build.md).

If you want to execute the epic wallet, in the root directory of your Epic Wallet installation open a new terminal session and execute the following steps:

 1. Navigate to where your epic-wallet binary was generated using the following command:

    ```sh
    cd target/release
    ```

 2. Configuring the **$PATH** environment variable

   ```sh
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(find . -iname librandomx.so | head -n 1 | xargs dirname | xargs realpath)
   ```

 3. If this is the first time executing the Epic wallet, you must initialize it first. This process will initialize your walletâ€™s database and create your secret master seed file. For this, we need to run the following command in the terminal:
  
    ```sh
    ./epic-wallet init
    ```

      More information about the wallet initialization can be found in the topic [Initialize the Wallet](https://github.com/EpicCash/epic/blob/master/doc/running.org#initializing-from-a-custom-directory).

4. After you have initialized your wallet, you can run it in listening mode executing the following command in the terminal:

      ```sh
      ./epic-wallet -e listen 
      ```

      More information about the epic wallet listening mode can be found in the topic [Running the wallet API](https://github.com/EpicCash/epic/blob/master/doc/running.org#running-the-wallet-api).
